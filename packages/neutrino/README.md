Neutrino is a configuration management tool for the webpack ecosystem that supports building, testing,
linting, and developing JavaScript projects based on shared configuration presets and middleware.
You can use Neutrino within your project alongside webpack, ESLint, Jest, Karma, and more of your
favorite CLI tools. It intends to make the process of initializing and building projects much simpler
by providing minimal development dependencies and tightening the integration between tools.

Neutrino supports webpack for building both web and Node.js projects by providing complete build presets which can be shared
across targets and projects. You can use Neutrino base presets to get started building a variety of projects, and you can create
your own presets by extending the Neutrino core ones to be shared across your own projects or even by the community.
Presets can even be manipulated on a project-by-project basis to handle almost any build situation your preset doesn't
cover.
