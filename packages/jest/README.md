# Neutrino Jest Preset

`@neutrinojs/jest` is a Neutrino preset that supports testing JavaScript projects with the Jest test runner.

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![NPM downloads][npm-downloads]][npm-url]

## Features

- Zero upfront configuration necessary to start testing
- Babel compilation that compiles your tests using the same Babel options used by your source code
- Source watching for re-running of tests on change
- Collecting test coverage information and generating report
- Easily extensible to customize your testing as needed

## Requirements

- Node.js ^8.10 or 10+
- Yarn v1.2.1+, or npm v5.4+
- Neutrino 9 and one of the Neutrino build presets
- webpack 4
- Jest 23

## Installation

`@neutrinojs/jest` can be installed via the Yarn or npm clients. Inside your project, make sure
`@neutrinojs/jest` and `jest` are development dependencies. You will also be using
another Neutrino preset for building your application source code.

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add --dev @neutrinojs/jest jest
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save-dev @neutrinojs/jest jest
```

### Installation: React Testing

Jest is often used in the testing of React components. If you are using this preset in a React application, which most
likely means you are using `@neutrinojs/react`, you should also consider adding React's TestUtils and potentially a
higher-level abstraction such as Airbnb's Enzyme. These should be development dependencies of your project.

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add --dev react-addons-test-utils enzyme
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save-dev react-addons-test-utils enzyme
```

See the [React's Test Utils documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html) for specifics on React
testing with this approach.

## Project Layout

`@neutrinojs/jest` follows the standard [project layout](https://neutrinojs.org/project-layout/) specified by Neutrino. This
means that by default all project test code should live in a directory named `test` in the root of the
project. Test files end in either `_test.js`, `.test.js`, `_test.jsx`, or `.test.jsx`.

## Quickstart

After adding the Jest preset to your Neutrino-built project, add a new directory named `test` in the root of the
project, with a single JS file named `simple_test.js` in it.

```bash
❯ mkdir test && touch test/simple_test.js
```

Edit your `test/simple_test.js` file with the following:

```js
describe('simple', () => {
  it('should be sane', () => {
    expect(false).not.toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Now update your project's `.neutrinorc.js` to add the `@neutrinojs/jest` preset. In this example,
let's pretend this is a Node.js project:

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    '@neutrinojs/node',
    '@neutrinojs/jest'
  ]
};
```

Create a `jest.config.js` file in the root of the project, that will be used by the Jest CLI:

```js
// jest.config.js
const neutrino = require('neutrino');

process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'test';

module.exports = neutrino().jest();
```

Then add these scripts entries to your `package.json` to simplify running Jest:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch"
  }
}
```

Run the tests, and view the results in your console:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn test

 PASS  test/simple_test.js

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.265s
Ran all test suites.
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm test

 PASS  test/simple_test.js

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.265s
Ran all test suites.
```

To run tests against files from your source code, simply import them:

```js
import thingToTest from '../src/thing';
```

For more details on specific Jest usage, please refer to their [documentation](https://jestjs.io/).

## Executing single tests

By default this preset will execute every test file located in your test directory ending in the appropriate file
extension. Pass specific test filenames to the Jest CLI to override this.

## Watching for changes

`@neutrinojs/jest` can watch for changes on your source directory and subsequently re-run tests. Simply pass
`--watch` to the Jest CLI (for example by using the `test:watch` scripts entry above).

## Coverage reporting

Jest has an integrated coverage reporter, which requires no configuration. To collect test coverage information and
generate a report, use the CLI's `--coverage` option.

## Additional CLI options

See the [Jest CLI options documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#running-from-the-command-line).

## Preset options

You can provide custom options and have them merged with this preset's default options, which are subsequently passed
to Jest. You can modify Jest settings from `.neutrinorc.js` by overriding with any options Jest accepts. In a standalone
Jest project this is typically done in the package.json file, but `@neutrinojs/jest` allows configuration through
this mechanism as well. This accepts the same configuration options as outlined in the
[Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration). Use an array pair instead of a string
to supply these options.

_Example: Turn off bailing on test failures._

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['@neutrinojs/jest', { bail: false }]
  ]
};
```

You might need to instruct Jest to load some setup scripts (e.g. when you use Enzyme). 

_Example: Jest setup scripts_

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['@neutrinojs/jest', {
      // setup script for the framework
      setupTestFrameworkScriptFile: '<rootDir>/test-setup.js',
      // and / or shims
      setupFiles: [
        '<rootDir>/shim.js'
      ]
    }]
  ]
};
```

<details>
  <summary>test-setup.js and shim.js</summary>

_test-setup.js for the example above_

```js
const Enzyme = require('enzyme');
const EnzymeAdapter = require('enzyme-adapter-react-16');

// Setup enzyme's react adapter
Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() });
```

_shim.js for the example above_

```js
global.requestAnimationFrame = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(callback, 0);
};
```

</details>

## Customizing

To override the test configuration, start with the documentation on [customization](https://neutrinojs.org/customization/).
`@neutrinojs/jest` creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are ready to make
changes.

### Rules

The following is a list of rules and their identifiers which can be overridden:

| Name | Description | NODE_ENV |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compile` | Compiles JS files from the `test` directory using adopted Babel settings from other build presets. Contains a single loader named `babel`. | all |

### Override configuration

By following the [customization guide](https://neutrinojs.org/customization/) and knowing the rule, and loader IDs above,
you can override and augment testing by providing a function to your `.neutrinorc.js` use array. You can also
make this change from the Neutrino API when using the `use` method.

In a standalone Jest project this is typically done in the package.json file, but `@neutrinojs/jest` allows
configuration through this mechanism as well. This accepts the same configuration options as outlined in the
[Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration). Use an array pair instead of a string
to supply these options.

_Example: Add a custom Babel plugin when testing:_

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    '@neutrinojs/jest',
    (neutrino) => {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
        neutrino.config.module
          .rule('compile')
          .use('babel')
          .tap(options => merge(options, {
            env: {
              test: {
                plugins: ['custom-babel-plugin']
              }
            }
          }));
      }
    }
  ],
};
```
