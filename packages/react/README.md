- Neutrino 9
- webpack 4
- webpack-cli 3
- webpack-dev-server 3

## Installation

`@neutrinojs/react` can be installed via the Yarn or npm clients. Inside your project, make sure
that the Neutrino and webpack related dependencies below are installed as development dependencies.
You will also need React and React DOM for actual React development.

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add --dev neutrino @neutrinojs/react webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
❯ yarn add react react-dom
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save-dev neutrino @neutrinojs/react webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
❯ npm install --save react react-dom
```

## Project Layout

`@neutrinojs/react` follows the standard [project layout](https://neutrinojs.org/project-layout/) specified by Neutrino. This
means that by default all project source code should live in a directory named `src` in the root of the
project. This includes JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets that would be available
to import your compiled project.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is by using the `create-project` scaffolding tool.
Don’t want to use the CLI helper? No worries, we have you covered with the [manual installation](#manual-installation).

### create-project

Run the following command to start the process. Substitute `<directory-name>` with the directory name you wish to create
for this project.


#### Yarn

```
❯ yarn create @neutrinojs/project <directory-name>
```

_Note: The `create` command is a shorthand that helps you do two things at once. See the [Yarn create docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) for more details._

#### npm/npx

[`npx`](https://github.com/zkat/npx) comes pre-installed with `npm`. If you’re running an older version of `npm`, then
`npm install -g npm` to update to the latest version.

```
❯ npx @neutrinojs/create-project <directory-name>
```

The CLI helper will prompt for the project to scaffold, and will offer to set
up a test runner as well as linting to your project. Refer to the [Create new project](https://neutrinojs.org/installation/create-new-project/) section
for details on all available options.

### Manual Installation

After installing Neutrino and the React preset, add a new directory named `src` in the root of the project, with
a single JS file named `index.js` in it.

```bash
❯ mkdir src && touch src/index.js
```

This React preset exposes an element in the page with an ID of `root` to which you can mount your application. Edit
your `src/index.js` file with the following:

```jsx
import { render } from 'react-dom';

render(<h1>Hello world!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Now edit your project's `package.json` to add commands for starting and building the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  }
}
```

Then create a `.neutrinorc.js` file alongside `package.json`, which contains your Neutrino configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  use: ['@neutrinojs/react']
};
```

And create a `webpack.config.js` file, that uses the Neutrino API to access the generated webpack config:

```js
const neutrino = require('neutrino');

module.exports = neutrino().webpack();
```

Start the app, then open a browser to the address in the console:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn start
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm start
```

## Building

`@neutrinojs/react` builds static assets to the `build` directory by default when running `yarn build`.
You can either serve or deploy the contents of this `build` directory as a static site.

## Static assets

If you wish to copy files to the build directory that are not imported from application code,
use the [@neutrinojs/copy](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/copy/) preset alongside this one.

## Deployment Path

By default `@neutrinojs/react` assumes that your application will be deployed at the root of a
domain (eg: `https://www.my-app.com/`), and so sets webpack's
[`output.publicPath`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-publicpath) to `'/'`,
which means assets will be loaded from the site root using absolute paths.

If your app is instead deployed within a subdirectory, you will need to adjust the `publicPath`
[preset option](#preset-options). For example if your app is hosted at
`https://my-username.github.io/my-app/`, you will need to set `publicPath` to `'/my-app/'`.

Alternatively, if you would like your app to be able to be served from any location, and are
not using the HTML5 pushState history API or client-side routing, then you can set `publicPath`
to the empty string, which will cause relative asset paths to be used instead.

## Preset options

You can provide custom options and have them merged with this preset's default options to easily affect how this
preset builds. You can modify React preset settings from `.neutrinorc.js` by overriding with an options object. Use
an array pair instead of a string to supply these options in `.neutrinorc.js`.

The following shows how you can pass an options object to the React preset and override its options. See the
[Web documentation](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/web/#preset-options) for specific options you can override with this object.

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    ['@neutrinojs/react', {
      /* preset options */

      // Example: disable Hot Module Replacement
      hot: false,

      // Controls webpack's `output.publicPath` setting.
      // See the "Deployment Path" section above for more info.
      publicPath: '/',

      // Example: change the page title
      html: {
        title: 'Epic React App'
      },

      // Target specific browsers with @babel/preset-env
      targets: {
        browsers: [
          'last 1 Chrome versions',
          'last 1 Firefox versions'
        ]
      },

      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options
      babel: {
        // Override options for @babel/preset-env:
        presets: [
          ['@babel/preset-env', {
            useBuiltIns: true,
          }]
        ]
      }
    }]
  ]
};
```

## Customizing

To override the build configuration, start with the documentation on [customization](https://neutrinojs.org/customization/).
`@neutrinojs/react` does not use any additional named rules, loaders, or plugins that aren't already in use by the
Web preset. See the [Web documentation customization](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/web/#customizing)
for preset-specific configuration to override.

For details on merging and overriding Babel configuration, such as supporting decorator syntax, read more
about using the [`compile-loader` `merge`](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/compile-loader/#advanced-merging) once you
are comfortable customizing your build.

If the need arises, you can also compile `node_modules` by referring to the relevant
[`compile-loader` documentation](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/compile-loader/#compiling-node_modules).

### Advanced configuration

By following the [customization guide](https://neutrinojs.org/customization/) and knowing the rule, loader, and plugin IDs from
`@neutrinojs/web`, you can override and augment the build by providing a function to your `.neutrinorc.js` use
array. You can also make these changes from the Neutrino API in custom middleware.

By default Neutrino, and therefore this preset, creates a single **main** `index` entry point to your application, and
this maps to the `index.*` file in the `src` directory. The extension is resolved by webpack. This value is provided by
`neutrino.options.mains` at `neutrino.options.mains.index`.

If you wish to output multiple pages, you can configure them like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  options: {
    mains: {
      index: {
        // outputs index.html from src/index.*
        entry: 'index',
        // Additional options are passed to html-webpack-plugin, and override
        // any defaults set via the preset's `html` option.
        title: 'Site Homepage',
      },
      admin: {
        // outputs admin.html from src/admin.*
        entry: 'admin',
        title: 'Admin Dashboard',
      },
      account: {
        // outputs account.html from src/user.* using a custom HTML template.
        entry: 'user',
        inject: true,
        template: 'my-custom-template.html',
      },
    }
  },
  use: ['@neutrinojs/react']
}
```

#### Vendoring

External dependencies are automatically split into separate chunks from the application code,
by the new webpack [SplitChunksPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/).

_Example: The splitChunks settings can be adjusted like so:_

```js
module.exports = {
  use: [
    '@neutrinojs/react',
    (neutrino) => {
      neutrino.config
        .optimization
          .merge({
            splitChunks: {
              // Decrease the minimum size before extra chunks are created, to 10KB
              minSize: 10000
            }
          });
    }
  ]
};
```

## Hot Module Replacement

While `@neutrinojs/react` supports Hot Module Replacement for your app using
React Hot Loader, it does require some application-specific changes in order to
operate.

First, install `react-hot-loader` as a dependency, this **must** be
React Hot Loader v4+:

#### Yarn

```bash
❯ yarn add react-hot-loader
```

#### npm

```bash
❯ npm install --save react-hot-loader
```

---

Neutrino will then automatically load React Hot Loader then next time a build
is performed. Next, you need to mark your root component as _hot-exported_.

For example, if your `src/index` main entry renders a root component from
`App.jsx`, then the exported component needs to have a hot export:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

const App = () => <div>Hello World!</div>

export default hot(module)(App);
```

See the [React Hot Loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)
docs for any API specifics on hot reloading other components.
